\chapter{Evaluation and Conclusion}

\label{section:Discussion}

This section will cover the disision of our proposed method framework, as well as discuss the implications of this method in comparison to existing models in our problemspace.
Section \ref{section:Discussion:Evaluation} will present an evaulation of the proposed framework.
After this, the propsed method is discussed in section \ref{section:Discussion:Discussion}.
The discussion section will cover the implications of the propsed method, as well as compare the propsed framework with existing solutions.
Section \ref{section:Discussion:Contributions} presents the contributions done in this paper,
followed by section \ref{section:Discussion:FutureWork} which lists future work to be done on the problem space and the presented framework.
