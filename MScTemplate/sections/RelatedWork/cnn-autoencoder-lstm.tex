\section{CNN LSTM Autoencoder }
A paper that uses the same method as us is the paper \cite{Khan2020}.
They use a a hybrid CNN with a long short-term memory autoencoder (LSTM-AE) to predict future energy
use in residential and commercial buildings.

Initially the CNN model extracts features from the input data, which are then fed to the LSTM-encoder
which encodes the sequence. The encoded sequence are past to the LSTM-decoder which outputs the prediction.

Electricity consumption is a multivariate time series problem.

Using a CNN model with a LSTM model has achieved state-of-the-art results for various domains,
Among them is emption recognition

speech processing [site],
activity recognition [site15].
