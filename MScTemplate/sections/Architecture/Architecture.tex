\chapter{Architecture/Model}
\label{section:Architecture}

In this section, we propose a framework architecture intended to solve the goal presented in \autoref{section:Introduction:Goal}.
First, in section \ref{section:Architecture:Model} the propesed model and architecure is presented.
\autoref{section:Architecture:DataExploration} describes our initial data analysis and data-exploration.
% TODO: Fjerne denne seksjonen?
%Section \ref{section:Architecture:ModelStructure} describes the intended use of data correlation in the available time series in order to increase predictive accuracy.
Lastly, section \ref{section:Architecture:ErrorMetric} lists the error metrics intended for use in the propsed solution.

  Here you will present the architecture or model that you have chosen, and that is (or will be) implemented in your work. Note that putting algorithms in your report is not desirable but in certain cases these might be placed in the appendix. Code further be avoided in the report itself but may be delivered in the fashion requested by the supervisor or, in the case of masters delivery, submitted as additional documents.
