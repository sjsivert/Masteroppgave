\section{Goals and Research Questions}
\label{section:Introduction:Goal}

This paper explores using machine-learning algorithms to accurately forecast the user interest in product categories on a price comparison website.
Exploiting the predictive abilities of deep Neural Networks such as Convolutional Neural Networks, Long-Short term memory, and Autoencoders,
we intend to introduce a new predictive model into the problem space.
The intention is to outperform the current state-of-the-art predictive algorithms in the problem space.

% TODO: Should we disclose that we are working with Prisguiden in this paper?
% Still unsure what conclusion we arrived at there.
The data supplied by "Prisguiden" contains historical data about user activity, such as visitation and click data.
We intend to use this data to predict future product and category trends based on the historical data.

\begin{description}
    \item[Goal]{\it To accuratly predict future product category trends based on historical visitation and click data using a Convolutional Autoencoder with LSTM.}
\end{description}

To measure the viability and accuracy of the proposed goal, we need to look into the already proposed methods in this problem space.
This is required in order to assess whether or not our goal is rendered mute due to previous solutions.


\begin{description}
    \item[RQ1]{\it What are the existing solutions for predicting future product category trends, or sales trends, based on historical time-series data?}
          % What are the existing solutions in problem space P? 
\end{description}

\begin{description}
    \item[RQ2]{\it How does the different solutions found by addressing RQ1 compare to each other?}
\end{description}

\begin{description}
    \item[RQ3]{\it What is lacking in the current solutions found by addressing RQ1, and how could these be improved upon?}
\end{description}


These three research questions are intended to be answered in this paper, addressed through a structured academic literature review.
