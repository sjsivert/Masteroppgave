\todo[inline]{Rewrite Preface. Add information about what is old and what is new}
This work is done as part of the master thesis. Some chapters har earlier been submitted and graded
as part of the fall project. They are included here for completeness. Those chapters are marked with a \textit{*}.
The previously written sections are most of \textit{Background [\Cref*{section:BT:BackgroundTheory}]}, most of
\textit{Related Work [\Cref*{section:RelatedWork}]} and \textit{Architecture/Model [\Cref{section:Architecture}]}.

We wish to thank our supervisor Anders Kofod-Petersen for his help and valuable feedback during this project.
Additionally, we would like to thank 'Prisguiden' for their help and cooperation,
as well as for the dataset and this intriguing project.

All of the code are open and available at [Github \cite{githubSource}].
