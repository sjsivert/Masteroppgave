The goal of this paper is to propose a method for achieving accurate time-series predictions in an e-commerce
problem space using a hybrid CNN-AE and LSTM method.
In order to achieve this goal, relevant research questions were presented.
Conducting a structured literature analysis of the current status of time-series prediction,
this paper aims to answer the proposed research questions.

Research questions 1 through 3 are addressed through a structured literature review.
Conducting a literature review, current time-series prediction methods are uncovered and compared.
Related work is discussed and reviewed in order to find ways to improve current solutions.
A predictive model is proposed in \Cref{section:Architecture} to solve the goal presented.
This Convolutional autoencoder and LSTM hybrid model is proposed as a method for exploring the goal presented.
The design is influenced by the state-of-the-art methods explored to answer the research questions.
With methods and approaches exploring what is missing from current e-commerce prediction methods,
such as the utilization of correlated time-series, the method aims to address the goal by using the research questions.
