\section{Additional Experiments plan}
After analyzing the initial results from our defined experiments
we formed some hypotheses which led to some additional experiments.
These experiments are described in this section.

\subsection{Experiment 4: Noisy datasets}
The CNN-AE-LSTM performed best on dataset 1, which we know
has the most noise. To confirm our hypothesis
that the CNN-AE-LSTM performs better than an LSTM
on noisy dataset we add three new datasets,
one set consists of noisy time series,
the other consists of time series with low noise.
In fear that the most noisy dataset would be too noisy to give any meaningfule
predictions we added the third dataset, which is has above average noise, but not
as much as the noisiest data set.

% Here we briefly describe the methodology behind the experiment.

\subsubsection{Choosing the datasets}
To make the two datasets we looked at the standard deviation.
Firstly we scaled down outliers which could skew the standard deviation of
a series to be higher. For this we used the same technique
as described in \Cref{section:Data:Preprocessing:scale-down-outliers}.

Then, for each time series in the whole dataset we did these steps
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Scale down the values to have a mean of 0 using standardization.
  \item Take the difference of $t_n - t_{n-1}$
  \item if the standard deviation of the remaining series is above $max\_threshold$ \-\> Add to max list
  \item if the standard deviation of the remaining series is below the $min\_threshold$ \-\> Add to min list
\end{enumerate}

The noisiest dataset had standard deviation above $max\_threshold = 1.3$.
The dataset with the least noise had a standard deviation below $min\_threshold = 0.4$.
The above average noisy dataset had a standard deviation above $ok\_threshold = 0.8$
but below the maximum threshold of 1.3.
From the remaining list we randomly picked 7 time series.

\subsubsection{Running the experiments}
The only two model structures we used were local univariate LSTM
and local univariate CNN-AE-LSTM.
We would follow the same procedure as previously described in \Cref{section:Method},
except we did not tune the hyperparameters. Instead, we
used a hyperparameter-set from a previously tuned experiment and used those for all the models.
This was done because of time constraints.

\begin{description}
  \item[Outline]{
              Train and test a local univariate LSTM,
              and a local univariate CNN-AE-LSTM on a noisy dataset, a low noise dataset, and a medium noisy dataset,
              using MASE and sMAPE as metrics on a 7-day forecast.
              Compare the results against each other.

\begin{description}
  \item[Expectations]{
              We expect the CNN-AE-LSTM to outperform the LSTM on the noisy datasets.
              We also expect the LSTM to have the best performance on the low noise datasets.
