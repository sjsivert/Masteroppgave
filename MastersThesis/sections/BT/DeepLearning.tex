\subsection{Deep learning*}

Deep learning is a field within artificial intelligence which are inspired by how the human brain works.
These neural networks are trained and used to accomplish tasks such as classification, clustering, natural language processing, predictive tasks, and much more.

\subsubsection{Supervised learning}
Supervised learning is a sub-field of machine learning where the focus is on training
machine-learning methods through the use of labeled data.
The method will attempt to access the data in correlation with the connected data label.
Classical problems within supervised learning are classification problems where the prediction of a label is the desired result.

\subsubsection{Unsupervised learning}
Unsupervised learning focuses on creating machine learning methods using data without a label.
The data has no "correct" label associated with it.
Applications of unsupervised learning might be clustering, anomaly detection recommendation systems.
