\subsection{Artificial Intelligence*}
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an umbrella term that encapsulates all algorithms that
show some intelligent behavior.

Machine Learning (ML), a subset of AI [\Cref{fig:venn-diagram-ml-deep-learning}], is a system that learns on its own through experiences.
A programmer does not explicitly program it. A ML process makes observations from data to identify possible
patterns that can inform future decisions. Machine Learning aims to allow a system to learn by itself through
experience without human intervention. Under the hood of many machine learning models are just plain statistics [\Cref{fig:venn-diagram-cs-ml-deep-learning}].
The major difference between machine learning and statistics is their purpose.
Statistics is the mathematical study of data.
Machine learning models are designed to make the most accurate predictions.
