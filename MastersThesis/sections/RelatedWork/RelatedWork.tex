\chapter{Related work}
\label{section:RelatedWork}

In order to find a fitting solution to the goal proposed in \Cref{section:Introduction:Goal} and its related research questions,
we need to assess what advances have been accomplished within the problem space.
We assess state-of-the-art methods in time-series prediction and loss functions.
With this, we are able to compare current solutions and methodology in order to answer our research questions.

This chapter starts with \Cref{section:RelatedWork:forecasting-ecommerce} introducing current and previous advances within e-commerce time-series forecasting.
\Cref{section:RelatedWork:Statistical-NN} explores the use of deep learning method in comparison with statistical methods.
Later, \Cref{section:RelatedWork:Model-structure} introduces the use of global and local methods, as well as univariate and multivariate methods.
\Cref{section:RelatedWork:Hybrid} introduces current state-of-the-art hybrid methods for forecasting.
Multi-step ahead predictions are pressented in \Cref{section:RelatedWork:multi-step-ahead},
before a critique of LSTM usage in literature is given in \Cref*{section:RelatedWork:Criticue}.

Lastly, selected literature from the \textit{Related work} section, which creates the basis for further experimentation and methods,
 are presented in \Cref{section:RelatedWork:SelectedLiterature}.
