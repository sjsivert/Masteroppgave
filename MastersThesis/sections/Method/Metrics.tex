\label{section:Method:Metrics}

Here we describe which loss function and metrics we use.

\subsection*{Loss function}
Since our datasets often contain a lot of outliers we decided not to use the well known
Mean Squared Error (MSE) [\Cref{section:BT:Loss}].
We used Mean Absolute Error (MAE) while training the neural networks. We can use the MAE during training because our data-preprocessing,
normalizes all the time series to be on the same scale.
Some experiments were done using both MASE and sMASE, but MAE did perform better.

\subsection*{Metrics}
%Since we are working with multiple time-series and each time-series might differ in scale.
When choosing an error metric, we have to accommodate a number of factors.
Since our time-series are of different scales, we cannot use a scale-dependent metric
like MSE or MAE on our test data, as the test data is never touched, each time series might be on different scales.

We use MASE with 1-day naive forecast, as well as MASE with a 7-day
naive forecast. This is because the 1-day naive forecast is a regular metric used
and can give a good impression of how the model performs.
However, a 7-day naive forecast will more closely represent a real-world application measure,
in reality, we do not have the information available to make a MASE measurement for a 7-day prediction.

A problem with MASE is that if a time series follows a random walk
then the best forecast will always be the naive forecast. MASE is therefore dependent on
how good the naive prediction is.
Therefore we also include sMASE as a metric.
sMASE will give a better impression of how well the our predicted forecasts fit the target values,
independently of the naive forecast.
In the chosen datasets zero values rarely occur so we can use sMAPE without
being afraid of division by zero [\Cref{section:BT:Loss}].
